windows cant access to github ,so my ex-girlfriend download the project and import it into an new android project

Two East China University of Science and Technology students finished the project together in June 2017.
This project is a simple but useful android app that help you to record what have you done.
All design work was finished by Chen Xinlei alone,and I was responibile for programming and fix the bug.
The sql server is based on AliCloud and it will expire on July,2017.
If I have spare time during this summer,I will remove all data to sqlLite on mobile phone.
